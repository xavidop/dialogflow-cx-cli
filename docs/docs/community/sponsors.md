# Sponsors

Do you or your company use cxcli?
You can help keep the project bug-free and feature rich by sponsoring the
project and its maintainers.

## GitHub Sponsors

GitHub Sponsors is a great way to contribute directly to the primary maintainer,
[xavidop](https://github.com/xavidop).

This money usually goes to buying coffee, beer, better hardware, and, hopefully,
one day, paying the bills.
