`cxcli` is a tool that helps Dialogflow CX users to test their projects and interact with them in multiple ways.
It is useful for your day-today taks or if you want to integrate it in your favorite CI.

This CLI also has text-to-speech and speech-to text capabilities allowing the interaction with Google Cloud Platform APIs.
