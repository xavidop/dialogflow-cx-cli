---

`cxcli` is a command-line tool that helps Dialogflow CX users test their agents and interact with them in various ways.
It is useful for your day-to-day tasks or if you want to integrate it with your favorite CI tool.

This CLI also allows you to interact with the [text-to-speech](/tts) and [speech-to text](/stt) APIs in Google Cloud.
